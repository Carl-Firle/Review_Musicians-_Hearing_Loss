# Portion of Affected Persons
## Barcharts and Tables

Bar charts of persons with notch (yellow) and hearing loss (red) in relation to sample size for each genre. The opacity decreases in relation to the study with the maximal sample size (_n_<sub>study</sub> / _n_<sub>max</sub>), i.e., bars with higher transparency have less validity. The bar number refers to the table row below the chart. In this way, the finding can be attributed to the corresponding publication. A detailed result list is reported in the main directory as `Summary Table`.
