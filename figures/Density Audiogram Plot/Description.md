# Density Audiogram Plots
Frequency distribution of retrieved hearing examination results in audiogram form according to genre subgroups. Values in the left grey box were published without frequency reporting. Values in the upper grey box lack dB reporting. Values in the overlapping region, dark grey box at the top left corner, were reported without frequency and loss in dB. The colour scale indicates how many results were found for the corresponding point value. For this purpose, we distinguished between findings with normal hearing (green), notch (yellow) and loss (red) in audiogram. Some studies corrected data for age using ISO others did not. Thus, the plots include heterogeneous data.
